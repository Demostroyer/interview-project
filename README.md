# interview-project
This is a final year project analysing the general patterns in common interview questions. 
The goals and questions of this project that we aim to answer are:
1) What algorithms to choose, and what categories are
these algorithms associated with.
2) How do these algorithms relate to the classic algorithms
and how similar are they.
3) How easy is it for a person to indentify the pattern of
the algorithm.
By using an online question bank of relevant questions, which focus on key areas of Data Structures and Algorithms, we aim to answer the above questions. The question bank chosen was www.leetcode.com. This site has many positives, mainly the ability to filter questions and that the site is regularly updated. 
To back up our decision on which standard algorithm the solution to a question matches, we will initially judge the question by using our native understanding. Then to back up our judgement, we shall use Control Flow Graphs. These graphs will hopefully be able to back up our reasoning with some solid evidence.
The deliverable from this project is a report which aims to guide any reader on how best to study algorithms and data structures.
