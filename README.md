# Analysing Real World Code Interview Questions to find Patterns.
This is a final year project analysing the general patterns in common interview questions. 
The goals and questions of this project that we aim to answer are:
1) What algorithms to choose, and what categories are
these algorithms associated with.
2) How do these algorithms relate to the classic algorithms
and how similar are they.
3) How easy is it for a person to indentify the pattern of
the algorithm.

By using an online question bank of relevant questions, which focus on key areas of Data Structures and Algorithms, we aim to answer the above questions. The question bank chosen was www.leetcode.com. This site has many positives, mainly the ability to filter questions and that the site is regularly updated. 
To back up our decision on which standard algorithm the solution to a question matches, we will initially judge the question by using our native understanding. Then to back up our judgement, we shall use Control Flow Graphs. These graphs will hopefully be able to back up our reasoning with some solid evidence.
The deliverable from this project is a report which aims to guide any reader on how best to study algorithms and data structures.

The source code for this project can be found inside mu_ian_dempsey/src. It can also be found in Appendix A inside of the Supporting folder. 
Appendix B inside this folder contains every Control Flow Graph that was designed by the author of this paper. 
Appendix C contains every image used in the paper, besides the Control Flow Graphs. 

Inside the Supporting folder there is a README.txt. This contains all of the relevant information for the Appendices, and how best to run and compile the code for this project.
