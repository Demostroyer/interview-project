# interview-project
This is a final year project analysing the general patterns in common interview questions. 
The goals and questions of this project that we aim to answer are:
1) What algorithms to choose, and what categories are
these algorithms associated with.
2) How do these algorithms relate to the classic algorithms
and how similar are they.
3) How easy is it for a person to indentify the pattern of
the algorithm.
