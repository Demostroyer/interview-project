The MergeSort pattern area needs work tbh. Needs to have one example included of it included to show how it is based off of the original pattern. 
Working on the CFGs at the moment. Want all algorithms done in the paper to be displayed firstly. 
Then work on the other questions solved. 
Have the area for the CFGs done up, have two exmaples shown in it to show how it backs up our decision on which is similar to it. 

Need to do the conclusion again.
Need to do the abstract, -> this comes from the combo of conclusion and introduction though.
