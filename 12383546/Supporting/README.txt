This folder contains the following appendices. 
Appendix A - Source Code. Inside this folder all of the source code used in this thesis are located.
Appendix B - Control Flow Graphs. This folder contains all of the CFGS which were created for each question. They are in .png format. They can be viewed in any modern photograph application on a standard computer. 
Appendix C - The screenshots of LeetCode. These are the images used throughout the thesis showing various functionality of LeetCode. This folder also contains the other images, such as Breadth-First Search.

To compile and run the code from this thesis it would be easiest to use LeetCode's online validator. This is because it has the Abstract Data Types(ADT) which some of the questions require, e.g. ListNode, TreeNode. Simply visit the website and look for the question via the number associated with the question. Copy paste the solution and press run. This will return the answer at the bottom of the screen. 
Some of the questions can be run outside of LeetCode, but these can still be ran through the website for simplicity.  
The code which must be ran on LeetCode are the questions relating to the ListNodes, TreeNodes and any other ADT.
