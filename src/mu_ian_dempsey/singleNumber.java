 * This is a problem on leetcode called the singleNumber problem. 
 * Given an array of integers, every element appears twice, EXCEPT for one. Find this single integer. 
 * Idea: Using binary search, have a counter that will be incremented to show that the number appeared twice. 
 * Then check if the counter is equal to 2, if it is , move on in the array to check the next integer. 
 * Else, return this as it has not appeared twice, so must be our single int!

 * The pattern in this is:
